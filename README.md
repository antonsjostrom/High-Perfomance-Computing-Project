# High Perfomance Computing Project
This repository showcases a C++ project I developed during my university studies. It features a Tic-Tac-Toe bot that implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The project's primary goal wasn't to create the strongest AI but to take a well-known strategy and optimize its speed to the maximum potential.

The bot represents the game board using two integers and employs bit manipulation to efficiently update board positions. Additionally, it utilizes parallel threads to further accelerate computations, enabling faster evaluation of possible moves. This approach significantly enhances memory efficiency and reduces the time required to determine the optimal move in any given scenario.

The result is a fast, lightweight, and highly optimized implementation of a classic problem in AI and computational optimization.
